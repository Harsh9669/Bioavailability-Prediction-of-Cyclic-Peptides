# Bioavailability-Prediction-of-Cyclic-Peptides
This repository contains the machine learning models to predict the permeability, gastric and intestinal stabilities and bioavailability of cyclic peptides. It also contains the code of a streamlit app which takes SMILES string of a compound as input and predicts the bioavailabiltiy.
